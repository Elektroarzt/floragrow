## Overview

This project revolves around the topic of smart irrigation in the smart home. First, I will release a soil moisture sensor. This sensor is powered by a power supply and connects via MQTT to an IoT software such as Home Assistant, ioBroker, Node-RED, or similar. Later, there will likely be a variant that is powered by a battery.
